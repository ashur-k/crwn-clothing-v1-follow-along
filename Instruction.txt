To create project 
    => npx create-react-app crwn-clothing --template cra-template-pwa

    Normally we use this 
        => npx create-react-app crwn-clothing

    I have used this command so I can create same tempalte as it was created in video

    [All that changed is that you are saying you want to run 
    create-react-app with the PWA (progressive web app) template 
    which adds the service-worker.js file. If you don't do this, 
    do not worry, there are just some additional steps that you 
    will have to do in the future when we get to the PWA section of 
    the course :)]

Commands Given When app was created:

    ==> yarn start
       Starts the development server.

    ==> yarn build
        Bundles the app into static files for production.

    ==>  yarn test
         Starts the test runner.

    ==> yarn eject
        Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
        and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

    ==> cd crwn-clothing
    ==> yarn start

    Installed NODE 
      ==> yarn add node-sass
        Copy pasted homepage.style.scss file

    After following along these steps server was showing error:
        Please note in video toutorial this error was shown while when instructor 
        first started server, and I didn't saw that error, I didn't follow steps 
        but later when I tried to get output on browser I was getting following error
            #############################################################
            Node Sass version 6.0.0 is incompatible with ^4.0.0 || ^5.0.0.
            Compiling...
            Failed to compile.
            #############################################################

        To solve error I tried to run following command and it didn't work on 
        powershell and commandprompt terminals, but when I tried the same following
        commands on git bash terminal they worked. Please follow them along in same order

                and make sure you are in the project directory { crwn-clothing  }
